              In a groundbreaking discovery, a well-respected Greek urologist has seemingly stumbled upon a potent new over-the-counter formula. This formula, when administered to men seeking to increase their size, has demonstrated the remarkable ability to enhance both length and girth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike temporary solutions, the formula created by Dr. Stewart Franks works at a structural level by repairing damaged endothelial cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              The disruption of the Endothelium, usually as a consequence of aging, is directly responsible for reduced performance. Dr. Franks's method of targeting the Endothelium Flow Disruptor, via the application of Jungle Beast Pro, has stunned sexual health researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
              To test the effectiveness of the formula, it was given to a group of 352 men between the ages of 30 and 95. All test group subjects reported noticeable increases in size within 6 weeks of continued usage, with many reporting success within 2 weeks. The best part is that no side effects were reported by the test users.
            </p>
            <p>
              A size enhancement specialist by the name of Ethan Cox, with the blessing of Dr. Franks, has made the formula readily available to the public. Mr. Cox has created a video that explains the process and how it works.
            </p>
            <p>
              But before you rush off to watch the breakthrough video, we here at Jay's Advice decided to put this size enhancement formula to the test...

              Hi, I'm William, an editor here at JA. I volunteered to be the guinea pig for this little experiment, to see if the formula was legit or total B.S.

              I was excited because, for a long time, my wife has been disappointed. It felt as if she was slowly drifting away in our relationship. I still loved her, and I still thought she was incredibly beautiful, but when it came to intimacy, I just couldn't perform the way I used to, and I didn't know why.
            </p>
            <p>
              Needless to say, our relationship was on the rocks... It felt like every little thing I did irritated her. After I would get home from work, she'd barely give me two words before she watched her shows and went to bed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The usual relationship stress kept building, and without normal release intimacy provides, I felt as if the pressure just kept increasing. For the first time in our marriage, I was very worried I would lose her...
            </p>
            <p>
            I used to think the blue pill would save us, and it kind of did. But then I got the side effects: nausea, headaches, diarrhea... not exactly "sexy" stuff. </p>
            <p>
              Worst of all,
              <span class="font-weight-bold">I was never in the mood for sex...</span>
              I would sit there on the bed with a weak 'drug-powered' erection,
              but with absolutely no desire to perform. It made intimacy very
              awkward...
            </p>
            <p>
              Especially because women need to feel desired to reach orgasm. Oh, and they can tell when you're not naturally excited and just faking the enhancement with a drug.
            </p>
            <p>
            After hearing about Dr. Franks's formula, I decided to put it to the test. At first, I didn't think a formula I could use at home was going to solve my problems. <strong>But it worked!</strong> No creams or pumps or any nonsense like that. It blew my mind (and my wife's mind, too). </p>

            <h4>Here's how it broke down...</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
              I ordered online, and it arrived within 3 days. I found out from the video that the size enhancement treatment has to be taken consistently for the best results. Following the instructions and kept note of my results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Day 1:&nbsp;</span> I woke up with a slight increase in size. I say 'slight' because it wasn't a full enhancement, but it was a little noticeable. Words can't describe how surprised I was by this; I hadn't experienced this in years.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never had a chance to see whether it would fully work because I had to get ready for work, and my wife wasn't home.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Day 3:</span> After waking up with a full increase in size, I decided to surprise the wife 😉. Luckily, it was a Saturday because she came back for seconds.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Day 7+:</span> At the end of the first week, the benefits seemed to fully kick in for me. Throughout the week, I'd been able to achieve several enhancements, but after 7 days, I was able to get them on demand.
            </p>

            <p>
            Not only was I able to achieve it, but I could keep it for a good 20 minutes. For me, that's basically a marathon. I think I was a bit <strong>thicker and fuller</strong> than usual, and oddly, I felt more sensitive to the touch. But that might be because I've been out of action for some time. </p>
            <div class="imgRight">
              <img src="./index_files/william3.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              <div class="caption">William Strazza (JA, 2024).</div>
            </div>
            <p>
            The only downside is that my <strong>libido has gone up a little too high</strong>. I find myself checking out women in public like I did in my early 20s. It can be a bit distracting, especially at work, and I hope my wife hasn't noticed my wandering eyes when we're out together. </p>
            <p>
              Despite this, I'm definitely going to keep using it. Mainly it works and I've had no side effects. And you can use it at home without trying to explain your needs to your doctor or getting funny looks at the pharmacy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Oh, and my wife has been acting super feminine and affectionate towards me, almost like we're teenagers and I'm her crush. I think, as I got more masculine and regained my confidence, she naturally became more feminine in response.
            </p>

            <p>
            Through our research, I found out that over <strong>40,000 </strong>men have been talking about how quickly and effectively Jungle Beast Pro increases their size, and now I'm so glad I found this scientifically tested solution. </p>

                  I was hesitant to rely on pharmaceuticals to address my ED, so
                  I turned to this natural supplement. I appreciate that it's
                  made from herbal ingredients with a long history of
                  traditional use. The gradual but consistent improvement in my
                  performance, coupled with the absence of side effects,
                  convinced me that I made the right choice. While it may not
                  provide instant results, the long-term benefits and natural
                  approach are what make this erectly dysfunction formula stand
                  out.*

                  Investing in this ED treatment was one of the best decisions
                  I've made for my sexual health. The price is reasonable
                  compared to the expensive prescription medications, and the
                  results are just as promising. Not only did it address my ED,
                  but it also boosted my overall energy levels and vitality.*
